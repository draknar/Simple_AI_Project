The point of this game is to corner the opponent's pieces into one spot.
You can move any group of pieces in any direction.
They will keep moving in that direction until they meet a wall or an opponent's piece.
If the group moves more than 1 space, it leaves behind pieces, except for it's starting location,
in a [0, 1, 2, the rest] pattern.

directions go from 1 to 8 in a clockwise direction, starting with 1 as UP.
